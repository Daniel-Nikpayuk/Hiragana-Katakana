Hiragana-Katakana
=================

A Javascript web-browser educational app allowing one to practice Hiragana and Katakana as flashcards with audio.

Just load the main Hiragana-Katakana.html in your own browser. I've tested it on Firefox (v41.0.2),
but I've heard it doesn't work on Safari. It uses some newer HTML5. Regardless, I did my best at a minimalist interface.
A few additional options allow for things like *memory shuffling* and convenience functions such as *repeat*.

I took 4 semesters of Japanese, and although the Inuit language certainly has some linguistic (especially phonetic)
similarities, I doubt my accent is especially Japanese. Feel free to record your own audio if mine is
insufficient; I will not be offended, haha.

Lastly, this might be useful code for those looking to learn programming. It is self contained and I'd like to think
it adheres to a few coding best practices.

Thank you.
